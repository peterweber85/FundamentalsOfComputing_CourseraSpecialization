Question 2

- Yes, the expected value for every node is the same. It is n*p.

- The distribution has a maximum at n*p and falls of on both sides.

- No, they are not similiar. The citation graph is monotonically decreasing.

Question 3

n = 28000
m =10

Question 5

- The in-degree distribution of the citation graph is similar to the DPA graph. They can be made almost equal when choosing the right parameters
for the DPA graph. They are both monotonically decreasing, have a similar functional form, can be chosen to have similar number of edges and nodes.

- The DPA graph can be explained with the phenomenon "six degrees of separation", the highest number of in-degrees is about 1/5 to 1/6 of the number of
number of nodes. Additionally, there are very few nodes with very few edges. Therefore, every node can be connected to any other node over distance 6.

- Yes, "six degrees of separation". See last two answers.
