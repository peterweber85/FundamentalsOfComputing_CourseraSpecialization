# Fundamentals of Computing Specialization by Coursera and Rice University

https://www.coursera.org/specializations/computer-fundamentals

* Interactive Programming Intro are the first 2 courses of the specialization. These courses introduce Python data structures and object-oriented programming.

* Principles of Computing corresponds to courses 3 and 4. These courses are heading towards more algorithmic schemes using probability theory and introducing Monte Carlo methods as well as searching, sorting and recursion.

* Algorithmic Thinking is significantly more advanced than the previous courses. This course teaches platform independent algorithmic techniques such as graph algorithms (breadth first search), divide and conquer algorithms, recursive vs. dynamic programming. Algorithmic Thinking consists of four assignments, of which each consists of the implementation of an algorithm (project), and the application of this algorithm to a dataset (application). The courses conclude with analysis of a genomic dataset in the last assignment (module 4).
